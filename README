# This library requires Coq 8.4 which you can get here:
#   http://coq.inria.fr/download
# Since it made some interface changes, it will likely be useful
# to have the latest proof general
#   http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/devel


# If you use proof general+emacs, then you can run
#
#   make .dir-locals.el
#
# in the top level directory to produce a .dir-locals.el. This will
# configure your proof general settings for this directory so that
# you can edit files interactively.
