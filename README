# This library requires Coq 8.4 which you can get here:
#   http://coq.inria.fr/download
# Since it made some interface changes, it will likely be useful
# to have the latest proof general
#   http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/devel


# You will need to add something like this to your .emacs
# replace PATH with the path to this directory
